# Syzygy Services — Contract Tests Reference

This document defines the canonical set of behaviour assertions every Syzygy Services
implementation must satisfy. It serves as the source of truth for cross-platform contract
compliance.

## How to use this document

Each section lists the minimum test cases required per module. Tests marked ✅ are already
implemented in this repo's test suite; tests marked 🔲 are not yet implemented.

| Recovers on Nth attempt after N-1 failures | ✅ |
| Logger receives request method, URL, headers (Authorization stripped) | ✅ |
| Logger receives response status, body size, elapsed time | ✅ |
| dispose() cancels in-flight requests | ✅ |
| dispose() is idempotent | ✅ |

## Persistence

| Test | Status |

| Stores and retrieves a value by key | ✅ |
| Returns undefined for missing key | ✅ |
| Type mismatch throws descriptive error with key name, stored type, requested type | ✅ |
| Secure storage stores and retrieves | ✅ |

## Auth

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| Initial state is unauthenticated | ✅ |
| setToken() transitions to authenticated | ✅ |
| clearTokens() transitions to unauthenticated | ✅ |
| refresh() POSTs to refreshUrl, updates stored tokens | ✅ |
| refresh() on expired JWT auto-refreshes before request | ✅ |
| refresh() failure transitions to unauthenticated | ✅ |
| canUseBiometric() returns false on stub | ✅ |
| authenticateWithBiometric() returns unauthenticated on stub | ✅ |

## FileManagement

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|

| deviceId() is stored under key "syzygy.device.uuid" | ✅ |

## RemoteConfig

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|

| Cache miss: fetch after TTL calls network | ✅ |

## Analytics

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|

| Sends and receives text messages | ✅ |
| onBinaryMessage() callback accessible via interface type | ✅ |
| simulateBinaryMessage() emits to binary callback | ✅ |
| dispose() closes connection | ✅ |
| dispose() is idempotent | ✅ |

## Idempotency Tests

| Module | Scenario | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| networking | `dispose()` called twice does not throw | ❌ (test not yet implemented) |
| websocket | `disconnect()` called before `connect()` does not throw | ❌ (test not yet implemented) |
| websocket | `disconnect()` called twice does not throw | ❌ (test not yet implemented) |
| auth | `signOut()` called when already signed out does not throw | ❌ (test not yet implemented) |
| persistence | `clear()` called on empty store does not throw | ❌ (test not yet implemented) |
